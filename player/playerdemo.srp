# IMPORTANT: SERVICE must be defined before you load playerbase.srp:
SERVICE = "demo"

# Now load playerbase.srp

// some simple music generation: Here are some problems with this:
// - not very interesting
// - no manual control of anything
// - does everything: bass, chord, melody, instead of one thing
// - all piano sounds
// - cannot handle cur_beats_per_measure properly (assumes 4)
// - plays absurdly fast at faster tempos
//

    #    cur_style - a symbol representing style to play (if
    #       this is not your style, do not play)
    #    cur_start_beat - what beat to start on if you are stopped
    #    cur_stop_beat - what beat to stop on if you have started (you can
    #       stop slightly late; generally you should not start any notes 
    #       at or after tm_stop_beat but you can play a short note on 
    #       tm_stop_beat if it is stylistically sensible.)
    #    cur_beats_per_measure - the current time signature as an integer
    #    cur_bps - current beats per second (the vtsched will implement this
    #       but reading the vtsched timemap slope is not reliable because
    #       vtsched may be updated instantaneously after this call.
    #    cur_scale - boolean array representing current scale
    #    cur_chord - boolean array representing current chord
    #    cur_bass - integer representing root of chord
